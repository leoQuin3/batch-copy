# batch-copy
A useful script I wrote to copy files from one drive to another (Using robocopy on Windows). Might come up with a Linux version later.

> **NOTE**: This script is under development and should **not** be used for critical tasks (e.g. backups), yet. The author is not responsible for any damage.

# Usage
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/leoQuin3/batch-copy.git`
2. Change dir to repo: `cd batch-copy`
4. Run batch file: `.\batchcopy.cmd`
